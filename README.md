# GAIDeT Declaration Generator

This is a **beta version** of the GAIDeT Declaration Generator â€” an interactive HTML tool that helps researchers transparently disclose the use of Generative AI (GAI) tools in scientific writing and research.
The declaration is based on the **GAIDeT taxonomy** (Generative AI Delegation Taxonomy), developed to promote transparency and accountability in academic publishing. It can be inserted into the *Methods*, *Acknowledgments*, or *CRediT* sections of a manuscript.
